# HPC-in-Econ-Basics

## Workshop 1: Coding & HPC Basics (April 1, 2025)

This workshop will cover the essentials of getting started with coding for research and software development, along with best practices. We will briefly discuss the local installation of R and Python before shifting our focus to high-performance computing and utilizing cluster-based resources on Koa. Through practical examples, we’ll explore fundamental coding concepts, including data structures, loading large datasets, efficient loops and multiprocessing, operationalizing code, and best practices for debugging and documentation—highlighting the role of AI in streamlining these processes. Additionally, we’ll cover key Python and R packages and how to manage environments across projects. We'll conclude with an overview of running scripts in the background and managing batch jobs on the cluster. We are going to move quickly, so I will provide resources to apply these concepts and continue learning beyond the workshop. 

## Workshop 2: Data Transfers & Documentation (April 4, 2025)

The second workshop in this three-part series will focus on best practices for data transfer and management, emphasizing remote transfers and efficient handling of large datasets using high-performance computing. We’ll cover various file transfer methods, including Rclone, Globus, scp, rsync, and wget, along with API usage on Koa. The session will also highlight the importance of open-source project development and documentation, covering version control fundamentals with GitHub and strategies for creating well-structured repositories.

## Workshop 3: AI & ML in Economics (April 15, 2025)

This workshop will focus on the applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in economic contexts. We will discuss best practices for developing and working with AI models, as well as the tools available in Python and R. The session will highlight potential use cases in economics and review the current state of the literature on foundational ML approaches (such as penalized regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods), causal machine learning, and contemporary deep learning techniques.
