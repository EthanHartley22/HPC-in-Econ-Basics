**Workshop_3_Slides** includes all the content for the third session in HPC-in-Econ-Basics series and focuses on *getting started with ML and AI*.  
- If interested in further exploration, I strongly encourage you to explore Kevin Murphy's books on probabilistic machine learning, which can be found [here](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/).

The file **Guide_to_Describing_ML_Methods.pdf** is a resource created by Dr. Peter Sadowski from the University of Hawaii, offering guidance on how to write an effective machine learning methods section.
